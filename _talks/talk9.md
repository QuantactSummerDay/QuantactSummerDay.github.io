## Robust gamma generalized linear models with applications in actuarial science

#### Yuxi Wang

Generalized linear models (GLMs) form one of the most popular classes of models in statistics. This class contains a large variety of regression models, such as logistic regression and gamma GLMs. In GLMs, the response variable distribution defines an exponential family. It is well known that these models are non-robust against outliers. From a Bayesian perspective, to our knowledge, there is no robust approach specific for GLMs. By leveraging ideas from frequentist robust linear regression, we adapt original GLMs to a robust version by replacing the distribution by a similar one, but with heavier tails, which allows to gain significantly in robustness. The focus is on gamma GLMs and applications in actuarial science.
