## Fast and Furious: An Intraday Analysis of Robinhood Users’ Trading Behavior

#### Clément Aymard, David Ardia and Tolga Cenesizoglu

We analyze the reaction of retail investors to price changes at the intraday level using hourly data on the number of investors holding a given stock on the Robinhood platform. We observe that (i) Robinhood users tend to open new positions on stocks exhibiting extreme returns in the past hours, (ii) this response to extreme returns is asymmetric, in the sense that it is more pronounced for stocks that experienced sharp declines in the last several hours, and, (iii) the speed of reaction is relatively fast with the net number of Robinhood investors opening a position in a given stock within an hour following a large negative return of that stock. Using proxy variables representing these patterns of Robinhood investors’ reaction to past returns, we identify their determinants in the time-series and cross-section. In the time series, we find that market volatility or investor sentiment can influence the day-to-day behavior of RH investors. In the cross-section, firm characteristics such as size, level of debt, or systematic risks are important determinants. Further analyses reveal that these results may vary before and after the market correction associated to the COVID-19 pandemic announcement.
