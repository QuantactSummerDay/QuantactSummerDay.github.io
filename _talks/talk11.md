## Modelling Electricity DART Spreads with Finite Mixture Models

#### Anthony Forgetta

We propose using a dynamic finite mixture model to describe the behavior of electricity DART spreads in Long Island, a single zone in theNYISO (New York Independent System Operator). Three regimes are considered: a regular DART regime, a positive spike regime, and a negative spike regime. We therefore attempt to model both the frequency and severity of DART spread spikes,  among  other  characteristics.The  covariates  considered  include  weather  data,  load data,  and  fuel  price  data.  Our  model  can  potentially  be  used  to  develop  a  risk  management framework for power merchants.
