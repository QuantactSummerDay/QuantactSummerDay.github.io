## Backtesting for Expectiles

####  Jesús Armando de Ita Solís
This talk starts with background information about the importance of risk management in financial institutions. Banks and insurance companies should have models to comply with the current regulations. To satisfy that purpose, the Value-at-Risk and the Expected Shortfall, the two most popular risk measures, have been used to fulfill those requirements. However, they have some disadvantages when used on real data. The expectile is a relatively new risk measure that offers some benefits over the VaR and the ES. Although its properties are well known and they have been already studied, there is still no backtesting procedure to test the efficiency of the expectiles when they are applied to real-life data found in the industry, and thus it has not been implemented yet as the standard risk measure by financial institutions.
