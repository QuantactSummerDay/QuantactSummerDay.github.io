## Double Generalized Linear Model (DGLM): Tweedie Distribution

####  Raïssa Coulibaly
In insurance pricing, the compound Poisson model with Gamma claims sizes is generally used to calculated the pure prenium. It is demonstrated that this approach has two parametrizations : the Poisson-Gamma parametrization and the Tweedie parametrization. Hence, the idea of this presentation is to compare these two parametrizations by evaluating the bias, the variance and the rmse (rooted mean square error) of the estimators in each parametrization.
